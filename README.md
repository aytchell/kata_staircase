# Staircase Problem

There is a staircase with n steps

## Task 1

Write a function `numWay(n: Int)`, which returns the number of ways you can
walk up the staircase by taking one or two steps at once (each combination of
it).

## Task 2

Write a function `numWays(n: Int, steps: List[Int])`, which returns the
number of way you can walk up the staircase by taking the steps (combinations
of it) defined in the list steps. So `numWays(n: Int, List(1, 2))` would be
Task 1.

## Bonus

Take Task 1 and/or Task 2 and return the actual ways
